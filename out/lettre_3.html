            <u>History and Theory</u>, in collaboration with Wesleyan's Center for the Humanities
            is planning a small conference for next March, to discuss issues raised in and by Hayden White
            's book Metahistory: The historical Imagination of Nineteenth century Europe. Although
            one sees this book
            increasingly cited in articles and other books, we believe that is has not received
            the thorough critical examination which it 
            deserves. It is highly original in its application of <strong>literary history</strong> to the <strong>history of historiography </strong>
            , and radical in its reformulation of <strong>historical relativism</strong> and other classic issues.
            </p>
         
         <p>
            The conference will be held in Middletownon March 16th and 17th, 1979
            Main papare will be given by Maurice Mandelbaum (Philosophy, John Hopkins and Dartmouth
            , Hans Kellner (History, Michigan State), Paul Hernadi (Comparative litterature
            Iowa), and Edward Said (English, Columbia). There will be critics
            for each paper, and we plan to leave plenty of time for both formal and informal discussion.
            We plan to limit the conference to forty
            participants, from history, literary theory and philosophy.

            We though that as a member of the Editorial Commitee you would like to know about
            the planning of this conference, and also
            to know that of course you are invited if you are interested, in participating. Since
            the budget for the conference is very low we can't
            offer to cover travel expanses, as we would like to do, but if you expect to be in
            the vicinity of Middletown
            next March in any case, by all means do let us know. We shall also be happy to send copies of
            the main papers,  at your
            request. Naturally we hope that they will later be published in <u>History and Theory</u>.
