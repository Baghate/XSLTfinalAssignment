               Dear Professor Aron
               </div>
         </div>
         
         
         <p>
            I am writing to you about tentative plans for assembling a small symposium to discuss
            <u><strong>Historicism</strong></u>
            We are at the moment concerned mainly with subject matter. No decisions have yet been
            made about date, site, nnumers, or foundation
            support. Fall 1972 or Spring 1973 are probable dates. I should greatly appreciate your help, answers,
            and comments \-\- including negative comments.
            </p>
         
         <p>
            The overall objectives of the symposium would be any (or all) of the following: (1)
            To discuss the history of the impact
            of <strong>historicism</strong> on some of the established disciplines. (2) To learn where <strong>historicism</strong> stands today
            . (3) To attemps to reduce the variety of usages of the term <strong>"historicism"</strong> to some workable characterization and,
            as a service to scholarshop, publicize our findings in <u>History and Theory.</u>
            </p>
         
         <p>
            It would help in planning to determine what kind or kinds of <strong>"historicism"</strong> the symposium should usefully
            confine itself. This need not be in contradiction to objective (3) ; it could be the
            first step towards it. For example,
            ProfessorMandelbaum -\-\- at length in his recent History, Man and Reason and more briefly in his 
            enclosed Encyclopedia article \-\- defines the term as the undestanding of phenomena
            through their place in a process 
            of <u>development.</u> As a <u>methodological principle</u>, rather than a <strong><em>Weltanschauung</em></strong>
            , he sees it to be relevant to such current topics of discussion as Piaget's <strong>developmentalism</strong>, 
            <strong>structuralism</strong> and as a reevaluation of <strong>Marxism</strong> (regarding <strong>orthodox Marxism</strong>as <strong>historicist</strong>
            and <strong>Marxian humanism</strong>as <strong>anti-historicist</strong>). Quite different issues might be raised by other kinds of
            characterizations, e.g. by Popper's linking of <strong>historicism</strong> to <strong>"holism"</strong>(involving
            i.a. the concepts of "laws") or by the identification of <strong>historicism</strong> with a concept of <strong>"historicity"</strong>of relevance to theology).
            </p>
         
         <p>
            <u>Do you agree that our undertaking requires some prior narrowing down of the term,
               and if so, have you any wider-ranging
               associations of <strong>"historicism</strong> in mind that might usefully be played down or excluded?</u>
            </p>
         
         <p>
            Participating speakers and auditors would mostrly represent specific disciplines.These
            might include "history" (perhaps a 
            sruvey of the classic development of <strong>historicism</strong>), "historicim and art history", "historicim and philosophy", "historical
            theology", "historicim and economics", as wells as, perhaps, "historicism and science"
            and the more recent "historicism and black history".
            </p>
         
         <p>
            <u>Would you be willing, in principle, to attend? Could you also let me know on what
               topic you may
               wish to read a paper (or shorter comment on some problem, book, or thinker)?</u>
